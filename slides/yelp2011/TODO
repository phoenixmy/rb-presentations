    Review groups - how would you recommend best using them?
    In general, what are some of the best practices of effective uses of ReviewBoard?
    Why are some things, like clicking on files to go to them, broken in Chrome.
    Anything you can talk about future direction of ReviewBoard / new feature plans would definitely be awesome.

  Alex:
    Please please please please I want http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/issues/detail?id=839 (convert tabs to n-spaces)

  Matt:
    I'd be curious to here their thoughts on when you should use code review (how early in the cycle should you start using it?).
    Also, what kind of tools do they use for more macro-level reviews (eg design-level stuff)?
    Have they used github pull request or rietveld or other code review systems? What does review board do better / worse, and how much of that is by design rather than time / difficulty?

  Jason:
    The design process for reviewboard (tradeoffs you make, how you test designs, what you are planning on working on in the future)
    An architecture overview
    Exciting things to look forward to
    Cool features we may not know about (DONE)
